## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - minimum version 0.48.
* [NodeJS 12.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation Instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

2. Clone the repo onto your local development machine using `git clone`.

### Installing the application

There are two SAM templates available - one provides an open API, the other uses an authorizer. From the command line, deploy the chosen SAM template:

```
cd .. 
sam deploy --guided
```

When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: s3Uploader
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- Accept all other defaults.

This takes several minutes to deploy. At the end of the deployment, note the output values, as you need these later.

- The APIendpoint value is important - it looks like https://ab123345677.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
- **The upload URL is your endpoint** with the /uploads route added - for example: https://ab123345677.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads.


### Testing with the Postman 

1. First, copy the API endpoint from the output of the deployment.
2. In the Postman interface, paste the API endpoint into the box labeled Enter request URL.
3. Choose Send

4. After the request is complete, the Body section shows a JSON response. The uploadURL attribute contains the signed URL. Copy this attribute to the clipboard.
5. Select the + icon next to the tabs to create a new request.
6. Using the dropdown, change the method from GET to PUT. Paste the URL into the Enter request URL box.
7. Choose the Body tab, then the binary radio button
